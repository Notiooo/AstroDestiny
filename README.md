<p>Your ship is about to enter the asteroid belt. As the only mechanical technician on the ship, you must repair the damage that occurs until the ship leaves the asteroid belt. If you are too slow the tentacles located in the black abyss will intrude. Act strategically, quickly and under stress!</p>

> Note: the game has negligible amounts of hard work, but it has lethal doses of stupid developer antics.
